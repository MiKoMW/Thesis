\section{Machine Learning Paradigms for Dialogue Modelling}

In this section, we describe the technical background of neural machine translation and language modelling, from mathematics to architectures. After that, we introduce the data and evaluation for machine translation. Finally, the later sections present the problem of domain mismatch and solutions related to our work.
